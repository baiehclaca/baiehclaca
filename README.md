> Building a1 at AETHER Research — an AI architecture that forms, recalls, and evolves its own memories. No context window. No forgetting.

## What I'm Building

- 🧠 **[AETHER Research](https://github.com/aether-research)** — A new AI architecture

- 🔍 **DevSearch** *(2022, retired)* — A search engine built for developers.

- 🔤 **[Caret Translate](https://github.com/baiehclaca/caret-translate)** - Translator app running in the background, easily accesible with a double push of TAB. Finds what word is in another language and translates it.

- ⌨️ **[GULA-GUG](https://github.com/baiehclaca/gula-gug)** - An AI Powered terminal for Windows making every error easily fixable and every command easily accessible.

- 📦 **.AIR** - Compress & Decompress powered engine for installing files fast. 

- 💾 **[SINGULAR QX](https://github.com/singularqx)** - A new chip architecture

## Past Lives

I've built a lot of things that never shipped and a few that did:

- 💻 Web development
- 🖥️ An almost-complete operating system
- 🎵 Music
- ⛓️ Blockchain payment system
- 📁 Games, social networks, cloud services, etc.
- 🔬 A chip architecture

## Tech I Love

Rust for systems. TypeScript + React + Next.js + Tailwind for interfaces. Framer Motion + Three.js for things that move. Claude for thinking. FoundationDB for remembering.

## Philosophy

> Ship it. Make it excellent. Don't ask permission.

I build things the way I think they should exist — maximum quality, no shortcuts. One-person company with an AI coworker. That's the whole team.
