> Building a1 at AETHER Research — an AI architecture that forms, recalls, and evolves its own memories. No context window. No forgetting.

## What I'm Building

- 🧠 **[AETHER Research](https://github.com/aether-research)** — Autonomous Episodic Thought and Hierarchical Evidence Reasoning. A new AI architecture where knowledge lives in cryptograms, recall happens through spreading activation, and the system supervises its own cognition.

- 🔍 **DevSearch** *(2022, retired)* — A search engine built for developers. Killed by the ChatGPT wave, but taught me everything about search, ranking, and what AI actually needs.

## Past Lives

I've built a lot of things that never shipped and a few that did:

- 🎵 Music — producer, composer, lifelong obsession
- 💻 Web development — freelance, dark themes, bold typography, minimal UI
- 🖥️ An almost-complete operating system
- ⛓️ Blockchain payment system
- 🎮 Games, social networks, cloud services, a streaming platform for books
- 🔬 A chip architecture too advanced for 2026

## Tech I Love

Rust for systems. TypeScript + React + Next.js + Tailwind for interfaces. Framer Motion + Three.js for things that move. Claude for thinking. FoundationDB for remembering.

## Philosophy

> Ship it. Make it excellent. Don't ask permission.

I build things the way I think they should exist — maximum quality, no shortcuts. One-person company with an AI coworker. That's the whole team.
